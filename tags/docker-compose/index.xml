          Immich (github) is a media library tool.
At some point I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my QNAP drives (both at the almost the same time) and wanted to check if I could replace the PhotoStation with an opensource tool.
Immich was one of the candidates but if has a major drawback for me. I dislike that it renames the files you upload/import/sync with it. Although it allows you to download them and the metadata it keeps (in a database) contain all the info and the result you get is the original filenames, you cannot suddenly stop using it and pick the file structure and use it.
