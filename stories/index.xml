          When I moved long time ago, most of my stuff where kind of put in boxes without labels.. as a result, especially those not really critical (never keep that stuff, they become expensive in various terms - time, space, sanity) they become forgotten and clutter.
So far I&amp;rsquo;ve found
old mobile phones network components (switches, ISDN routers, access points) handheld devices hard disks old desktop computers motherboards cables (serial, parallel, scsi, tons of usb-A) PSUs voip phones, ATAs magazines, books, manuals cdroms, floppy disks, even 8mm tapes (films) pictures, photos, manuals, skus and possibly links to get these will be added later.
